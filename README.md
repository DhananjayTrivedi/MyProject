# Internal Recruitment System For Organisation

Organization Internal Recruitment System helps Managers allocate unallocated employees to their projects depending upon the requirements. The managers raise a REQUISITION REQUEST where they give the required inputs and the request is raised to the RMG Executive. The executive has the access to data of the unallocated employees and as per the requirements he gives SUGGESTION back to the MANAGER. It's up to the MANAGER to accept/reject those suggestions. If MANAGER accepts, the data for the unallocated employees have to be updated in the database so that they don't get reassigned until released.
